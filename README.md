# NordicDSL

This project investigated the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) task. The project was an indepent MSc level project at the IT University of Copenhagen. 

It develop a machine learning based pipeline for automatic language identification for the Nordic languages. Concretely we will focus on discrimination between six similar Nordic languages: Danish, Swedish, Norwegian (Nynorsk), Norwegian (Bokm√•l), Faroese and Icelandic. Multiple neural and non-neural approaches were evaluated for this novel framing of a difficult task, across genres, leading to good results.
